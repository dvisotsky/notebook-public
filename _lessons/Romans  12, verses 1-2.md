**What makes a good best friend?**

Romans 12 - The Cliff notes of spirituality

Romans is one of the most dense books - it delves deeply into what salvation is for the Jew and the Gentile.

1. I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
    
2. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.    


Look at what the world wants from us vs what God wants from us.

* Which one would you rather have as a best friend?
*  As a father?
* Which one leads to a happier life?

Then why are you still so wrapped up in your appearance?

1st John 2:15-17

The world looks to seduce us by pleasure, possessions, and position.

Sex, Salary, and Status

But we should love the world around us instead of ourselves.

Colossians 3

1 Corinthians 1:10

**Where does the Living Sacrifice part come in?**
