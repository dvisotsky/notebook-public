## Prelude

Matthew was a tax collector

- educated
- literate
- was a disciple of Jesus himself
- he starts his book with a genealogy, why?
  - doesn't he know that we usually skip those?

## First thoughts:

**Q: does anything stand out to you?**

- Organized in 3 groups of 14.
  - Abraham - the origin of Israel as a nation
  - David - the Kingdom era of Israel
  - Exile - when there were no Israelite rulers over Israel and the nation was conquered
  - 14 because the numeric value of the Hebrew letters to spell "David" add up to 14
    - ד ו ד, dalet + waw + dalet, 4+6+4 = 14
- Important figures include Abraham, Ruth, David, Solomon
- not all men
  - Tamar:
  - Rahab:
  - Ruth:
  - Bathsheba: adulteress, wife of a Hitite (Also a Gentile)
- Joseph was not related by blood to Jesus
  - This is a legal lineage instead to back up Jesus' claim to be the Messiah

## Abraham's 7

**Q: Why start with Abraham?**
Who is Abraham? _The father of Israel_

- God promised Abraham that "... all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him" (Genesis 22:18) - Jesus is the manifestation of that blessing
- Through Abraham God shows that his promises are never void, even 2000 years later.

* **Tamar**
  - Sold herself as a prostitute to her father-in-law Judah to have children (Genesis 38)
    - she was a widow and sold herself to Judah because he neglected his duty as her father in law
    - Judah said that she was "more righteous than I"

- **Rahab**
  - A Gentile living in Jericho at the time of the Israelite conquest
- **Ruth**
  - Moabite, prohibited from joining Israel (Deuteronomy 23:3)
  - widow and daughter-in-law of a widow
    **Q: why include the women of questionable reputation?**
- It could have been Sarah, Rachel, Rebecca

## David's 7

- Shows that Jesus is of a royal line
- David was the youngest son of Jesse but became one of the greatest kings of Israel, only comparable to his son
- **The wife of uriah** (Bathsheba)
  - Wife of a Hitite
  - Adulteress

## Exile's 7

- It's impressive that these names are here at all, Israel had been upturned and conquered by Babylon
- Isaiah 53:2-3
  - He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.

## Conclusion

**Jesus:** - an Israelite and can be traced back to Abraham - is royalty and is a descendant of David - will not align with the Messiah that the people thought he would be
