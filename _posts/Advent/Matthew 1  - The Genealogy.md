## Prelude
Matthew was a tax collector
- educated
- literate
- was a disciple of Jesus himself
- he starts his book with a genealogy, why?
	- doesn't he know that we usually skip those?
 
## First thoughts:
**Q: does anything stand out to you?**
- Organized in 3 groups of 14.
	- Abraham - the origin of Israel as a nation
	- David - the Kingdom era of Israel
	- Exile - when there were no Israelite rulers over Israel and the nation was conquered
	 - 14 because the numeric value of the Hebrew letters to spell "David" add up to 14
		  - ד ו ד, dalet + waw + dalet, 4+6+4 = 14
- Important figures include Abraham, Ruth, David, Solomon
- not all men
	- Tamar: 
	 - Rahab: 
	 - Ruth: 
	 - Bathsheba: adulteress, wife of a Hitite (Also a Gentile)
- Joseph was not related by blood to Jesus
	- This is a legal lineage instead to back up Jesus' claim to be the Messiah
## Abraham's 7
**Q: Why start with Abraham?**
Who is Abraham? *The father of Israel*
- God promised Abraham that "... all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him" (Genesis 22:18) - Jesus is the manifestation of that blessing
- Through Abraham God shows that his promises are never void, even 2000 years later.
* **Tamar**
	* Sold herself as a prostitute to her father-in-law Judah to have children (Genesis 38)
		 - she was a widow and sold herself to Judah because he neglected his duty as her father in law
		 - Judah said that she was "more righteous than I"
- **Rahab**
	- A Gentile living in Jericho at the time of the Israelite conquest 
 - **Ruth**
	 - Moabite, prohibited from joining Israel (Deuteronomy 23:3)
	 - widow and daughter-in-law of a widow
  **Q: why include the women of questionable reputation?**
  - It could have been Sarah, Rachel, Rebecca
## David's 7
- Shows that Jesus is of a royal line
- David was the youngest son of Jesse but became one of the greatest kings of Israel, only comparable to his son
- **The wife of uriah** (Bathsheba)
	- Wife of a Hitite
	- Adulteress
## Exile's 7
- It's impressive that these names are here at all, Israel had been upturned and conquered by Babylon
- Isaiah 53:2-3
	- He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.

## Conclusion
**Jesus:**
	- an Israelite and can be traced back to Abraham
	- is royalty and is a descendant of David
	- will not align with the Messiah that the people thought he would be
