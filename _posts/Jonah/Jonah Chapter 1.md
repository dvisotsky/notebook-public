#Jonah #bible_study 

Intro questions:
1. What are some character traits of Jonah?
2. What are you hoping to learn from Jonah?

## Jonah 1:1-3
Jonah is given a message by God to go to Nineveh and announce its judgement.

* Jonah is given a message from God directly.
* Nineveh is a great and evil city. 
* Jonah doesn't want to go there and goes directly against God's instructions

**Main character: Jonah**
	Knows God but goes against His plan anyway
	Can we blame him? Nineveh must have been pretty bad.
**Conflict: going to Nineveh**
	City of sinners
	God wishes to give them one last chance in the form of Jonah
	 Was is like Las Vegas?

We have a clear direction for this story in the first 4 verses of the book.

## Jonah 1:4-6
The sea becomes very stormy. Jonah is sleeping through it.

Mirrors *Matthew 8:23-27*

**Discuss the similarities and differences of these 2 passages**
* Jonah's storm is because of his disobedience, and is an attempt from God to turn Jonah around.
* Jesus' storm was meant to bolster the faith of the disciples.
* Jonah slept in an attempt to block God out, ride out the storm.
* Jesus could sleep because he had complete faith in God.

Example:
* It's 3 am. You're in a tent. It's raining. There's water dripping right next to you. You try to sleep and wait for morning to take care of it.

## Jonah 1:9-10
The sailors wake Jonah and ask him about himself.

>'I am a Hebrew, and I fear the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land'
>\- Jonah

**Discuss**: What is ironic about what Jonah tells the sailors about himself?
Jonah claims to fear God. Jonah knows who made the sea and the dry land and yet, here he is.

It's easy to poke fun of Jonah for this nonsense answer, but we do the same thing.
How often do we recite cookie cutter theological answers and rattle off prayers like we're trained to do?
Jonah knew these answers, but regurgitated them as if for a test. 
His actions prove that what he says and what he does are different, to say the least.


## Jonah 1:11-12
Jonah asks to be thrown into the sea and the sailors eventually comply.

**Discuss**: Was this a good solution?
'Pick me up and hurl me into the sea; then the sea will quiet down for you.'
Jonah's solution is to die.
Not prayer, not compliance with God's will, he just wants to quit.

Jonah is stubborn enough to die rather than just stop for a second and reflect.
He knows of God's mercy, it's the reason he was sent to Nineveh in the first place.
But his pride and stubbornness blind him.

## Jonah 1:13-17
Focus: Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they could not, for the sea grew more and more tempestuous against them.

Discuss: 
Here, the *pagan sailors* who do not know God show more compassion and grace towards Jonah than he did towards Nineveh.
Only when they can see no other options do they do what Jonah asks.

It is the sailors who pray to God, not the Prophet.
The sailors are more humble and can see that there is no point in going against God's will.

Jonah gets his wish of being thrown overboard, but God is not done with him yet.
Despite Jonah's best efforts to run, God sticks with him to fulfill his plan.

Sometimes, unbelievers show more godliness than those who have about known God since they knew their right from their left.
It's not about what you know about God, it's about what you do with it.

1. If your actions show less love and respect for the world around you than an atheist, what kind of God are you serving? And why would anyone want to serve a God like that if His representatives act disrespectfully?
2. Despite Jonah's mistakes and despite the evil of Nineveh, God keeps giving out more chances for people to find Him. God wants our company and he loves us enough to look past our innumerous mistakes to have a chance at being connected to us. God loves you, and if you have not experienced that for yourself, don't wait for a fish to swallow you.
