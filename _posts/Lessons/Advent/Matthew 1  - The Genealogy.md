## Prelude
Matthew was a tax collector
- educated
- literate
- was a disciple of Jesus himself
- he starts his book with a genealogy, why?
	- doesn't he know that we usually skip those?

## First thoughts:
- Organized in 3 groups of 14.
- Important figures include Abraham, Ruth, David, Solomon
- not all men
	- Tamar: 
	 - Rahab: Prostitute from Jericho that save the Israelite Spies
	 - Ruth: Moabite, Gentile, widow and daughter-in-law of a widow
	 - Bathsheba: adulteress, wife of a Hitite (Also a Gentile)
 
- Joseph was not related by blood to Jesus
	- This is a legal lineage instead to back up Jesus' claim to be the Messiah

## Abraham's 7
Who is Abraham? *The father of Judaism*
- God promised Abraham that "... all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him" (Genesis 22:18)
	- Jesus is the manifestation of that blessing
- Through Abraham God shows that his promises are never void, even 2000 years later.
* **Tamar**
	* Sold herself as a prostitute to her father-in-law Judah to have children (Genesis 38)
		 - she was a widow and sold herself to Judah because he neglected his duty as her father in law
		 - Judah said that she was "more righteous than I"
- **Rahab**
	- A Gentile living in Jericho at the time of the Israelite conquest 
   


## David's 7
- David was the youngest son of Jesse
- 


## Exile's 7
"like a root out of dry ground"
