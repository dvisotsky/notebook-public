What's the difference between meditation and prayer?

Why do you pray? 
What do you expect to happen from prayer?
* If you pray for no rain do you pack an umbrella?

Why do we need a Bible Study on prayer?
What problems do we have with our prayer life?

* not consistent
	* Pray without ceasing  ->  1 Thessalonians 5:16:18
	* Daniel praying consistently -> Daniel 6:10
* not deep
	* Jesus retreating to pray -> 
		* Matthew 14:23
		* Luke 4
		* Mark 6:30
		* Matthew 14:1-13
* without faith, without heart
	* Elijah vs Prophets of Baal -> 1 Kings 18:30-38
		* (happened during a drought)
		

Prayer is an intimate connection between you, a human among billions, and God, the creator of the universe. 
You speak and create drama, He speaks solar systems into existence.
You cant lift 200, he lifted the weight of your lifetime of sin and carried it to the grave and back; just for you.
God wants to talk with you.
Not just joke around and share what a busy week it's been, He wants you to bring your anxieties and worries to Him.
He wants you to be confident and happy with the direction your life is going, no matter the circumstances.

So if your prayer life consists of a *thanks for the food, and keep me safe on the road*, you are squandering a direct connection to the one who crafted your being, down to each individual nucleotide in your DNA.

Maybe it's because you just don't know what you're missing, maybe you used to have a strong prayer life but it has faded over time into something more mechanical.
Or maybe you're just afraid that if you open those floodgates your comfort bubble will pop and God's plan is not something you're ready to face.

Whatever the case, I encourage you to have an earnest conversation with God tonight, He knows what you're going through

Don't base your prayer on forgiveness on feelings because you might not feel forgiven but that doesn't mean that you aren't. Dont wallow in self pity and move on and do better.
