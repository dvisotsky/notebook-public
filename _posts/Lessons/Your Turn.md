You will be creating your own Bible Study today on one of these historical figures:
- Samson
- Gideon
- Ruth

Your Bible Study should cover the following objectives:
- Who is this person? 
	- Give us some contextual info, history, accomplishments
- What challenges did they face?
	- How did they succeed or fail?
- What impact have they made on the modern world?
- What can I learn from this person?

It might be easier to split your group by objective,
So each person covers one of these objectives.

The presentation is up to you, but I encourage multiple people to speak because one person will not know all of the objectives.
