## Quick Recap
Jonah was a prophet.
Assigned by God to preach to Nineveh and encourage it to repent.
- Nineveh was not just Las Vegas or LA. It was a nation that was against Israel and would later conquer part of it.
- At that time the Assyrian empire was one of the cruelest and most aggressive in Mesopotamia. The Assyrians had destroyed scores of cities and villages and forcibly relocated or enslaved other groups of people, cutting a large swath along the Fertile Crescent. In the 720s BCE, they attacked and conquered Israel, the prosperous northernmost Jewish kingdom, and the southern kingdom, Judah, was reduced to paying heavy tribute. Assyria was thus one of the Jewsâ€™ most feared and hated enemies. - [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jonah-biblical-figure)
