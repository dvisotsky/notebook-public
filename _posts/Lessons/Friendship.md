**Goal**: Unity within the youth. Less cliques and more inclusion.

We touched on friendship during the Romans 12 study.
[[Romans  12, verses 1-2]]

I had you describe the characteristics of a good friend.

> Whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer harm.  
> \- Proverbs 13:20

*story time*
I talked to a young boy at camp that was in my group last year, he had gotten into a fight with his long time friend. But this guy didn't want to fight. He saw that his friend was not making the right choices in life lately, and even though their parents were friends he saw that they were drifting apart. This camper expressed that he wanted to grow closer to God but whenever he hung out with this friend he ended up doing things that made him feel guilty.
The kicker was that he did not have any ill will towards his friend even though the friend had been wanting to square up and fight and was pestering the boy all day.
The boy was trained in karate and knew he could take his friend down if he wanted to, but refused to do so because it would embarrass his friend.

My goal in telling you this is for you to examine what kind of friend you are to those around you.
In your friend group, what is your role? Do you elevate those around you or are you the one coming up with ideas that will cause guilt later?

We've seen a real life example, let's see what the Bible says about it.

How often should you forgive?
> Then Peter came up and said to him, "Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?" Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven" \- Matthew 18:21-22

How do you resolve conflict?
> If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses \- Matthew 18:15

Don't be afraid to talk things out with people.
Miscommunication is the root of like 90% of arguments.
Bottling things up and venting to your friends only serves to build up grudges and spread gossip.

Talk things out, forgive, and move on together.

We are stronger *together*.
Remember our study on [[Unity]]?
We need each other, every single person here brings something of value, and if you don't see that, maybe you are part of the problem.

I'd like to encourage you to be friendly with each other, be *inclusive*, and in the long term it will be better not only for you but for your youth as a whole.
