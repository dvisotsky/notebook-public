Board game Go

Earliest records are from the 4th Century BC; it was being played in China at the same time as Jesus was preaching in the Middle East.

  

The game is simple: 

- Take turns placing stones on the board
- Surrounding a group of stones captures them
- Stones must stick together and have a strategy to not be surrounded
- They must have a common goal and deep reliance on each other to succeed
- None of them can make it on their own, their strength comes from each other

And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand him - a threefold cord is not quickly broken. 
- Ecclesiastes 4:12

  
A rope is not called “a bunch thread,” the individual strands come together to make something stronger and are recognized by their whole, not individual parts. 

Unity comes through giving up self for the sake of others

Nehemiah 2 - 4

Context: 

Babylon: Capital of the Persian Empire - 400s BC

Nehemiah - a Jew living in Babylon, has a desire to go back to his roots and rebuild Jerusalem. 

Gets permission from Artaxerxes and sets out to restore his heritage

Sanballat - a Samaritan, opposed the restoration of the walls.


Nehemiah had a vision of his city restored.

He organized his people to have specific tasks and strive towards a common goal.

Nehemiah is remembered as the one who restored the wall. The Israelites gave up their independence for the sake of unity and progress.

  

Photo Mosaic - individual photos are blurred together to shape a bigger picture.

When unity happens, individuals fade into the common goal. 

Sanballat is remembered because he opposed Nehemiah. 


How can you personally strive towards unity?

Anyone can be good friends with people with similar interests.

- Be encouraging on the volleyball court
- Give compliments more often than disses
- Show interest in other people
- Care about other instead of laughing about them

What takes effort is being caring towards everyone - giving up your pride, time, social battery, whatever else it takes so that you can look at each day after it’s over and know that God would be proud of you.

Ecclesiastes  4:12
